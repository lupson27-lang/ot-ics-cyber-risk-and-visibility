# OT / ICS Cyber Risk and Visibility

A governance-focused exploration of cybersecurity risk, monitoring limitations, and visibility constraints in Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Control System (ICS) environments.

This project approaches OT security from a **risk, safety, and governance perspective**, rather than a tool-centric or purely technical lens.

---

## Overview

OT and ICS environments differ fundamentally from traditional IT systems. Security controls, monitoring capabilities, and response actions are constrained by operational, safety, and availability requirements.

This repository examines how those constraints shape cybersecurity risk, how visibility gaps emerge, and how organizations should reason about OT cyber risk at a governance and leadership level.

---

## Key Themes

- Differences between IT and OT security assumptions
- Visibility and monitoring limitations in industrial environments
- Constraints on detection and response
- Explicit risk acceptance and safety tradeoffs
- Governance and executive accountability

## Scope and Intent

This project is intentionally:
- Vendor-neutral
- Non-operational
- Governance-oriented

It does **not** include:
- Tool configuration
- Exploit techniques
- Detailed control system architectures

Instead, it focuses on how organizations **think about and manage OT cyber risk**.

---

## Intended Audience

This repository is intended for:
- Cybersecurity professionals transitioning into OT-aware roles
- GRC and risk practitioners supporting industrial environments
- Security leaders responsible for OT risk oversight
- Auditors and governance stakeholders seeking context

---

## Relationship to Enterprise Risk Management

OT cyber risk cannot be fully mitigated through technical controls alone. It must be:
- Explicitly documented
- Understood in safety and operational context
- Accepted or mitigated at the appropriate leadership level

This repository supports that governance conversation.
